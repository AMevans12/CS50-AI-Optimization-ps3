# CS50 AI Week 3: Optimization

## Overview

This repository contains the solution to the crossword optimization problem from Week 3 of the CS50 AI course. The project aims to fill in a crossword puzzle efficiently using optimization techniques such as constraint satisfaction and backtracking.

## Project Description

### Crossword Optimization

The crossword optimization problem involves placing words into a crossword grid such that they fit both the given horizontal and vertical constraints. This is achieved using the following techniques:

- **Constraint Satisfaction:** Ensuring that words fit within the grid's constraints and intersect correctly with other words.
- **Backtracking:** Systematically trying and eliminating options to find a valid solution.


## Installation

To use the code in this repository, clone the repository and ensure you have Python installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AMevans12/CS50-AI-Uncertainty-ps2.git
cd CS50-AI-Uncertainty-ps2
```

There are no additional dependencies beyond Pythonâ€™s standard library.

## Usage

To solve a crossword puzzle, run the `crossword.py` script with the desired puzzle and word list.

```bash
python crossword.py data/puzzle.txt data/words.txt
```
